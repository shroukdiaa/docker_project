# **Project Report on Data Analysis and Model Development Using Docker**

## **Part 1: Data Analysis and Model Development**

### 1. **Problem Definition and Understanding**

In this project, we defined a problem of predicting product sales based on a set of features collected from the data. The goal was to build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast future values based on input data.

### 2. **Data Collection and Integration**

Data was collected from multiple sources and merged into a single dataset for use in model training. We used the `pandas` library to read and integrate the data:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Reading data from multiple files and merging
data1 = pd.read_csv('path_to_data1.csv')
data2 = pd.read_csv('path_to_data2.csv')
merged_data = pd.merge(data1, data2, on='common_column')
```

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

After collecting the data, we explored it using descriptive statistics and analyzed relationships between features:
```python
print(data.info())
print(data.describe())
```
We also visualized the patterns using plots:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.pairplot(data)
plt.show()
```

### 4. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**

The data was cleaned using various techniques such as handling missing values and converting categorical data to numeric:
```python
data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)  # Filling missing values
data['category'] = data['category'].astype('category').cat.codes  # Converting categorical data to numbers
```

### 5. **Feature Selection and Engineering**

We identified important features using a correlation matrix:
```python
correlation_matrix = data.corr()
print(correlation_matrix['target_column'])
```

### 6. **Model Selection and Implementation**

We selected a linear regression algorithm to build the model and split the data into training and testing sets:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = data['target']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 7. **Evaluation Metrics and Results Interpretation**

We evaluated the model using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

### 8. **Documentation and Communication**

All operations were documented using `Jupyter Notebook`, and results were communicated through visualizations and explanations to make the findings easy to understand.

## **Part 2: Docker Implementation**

### 1. **Docker Implementation**

We used Docker to containerize the application and machine learning model. A `Dockerfile` was created to define the container setup:
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 2. **Data Processing in Containers**

Inside the container, data was processed using `pandas` and other tools. The container was able to handle data efficiently.

### 3. **Model Training and Evaluation in Containers**

The model was trained inside the container using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t model-container .
docker run model-container
```

### 4. **Docker Compose**

We used Docker Compose to coordinate and run services uniformly. A `docker-compose.yml` file was created to define container settings:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

### 5. **Integration with Version Control using Git**

The project was integrated with Git for version control:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git push origin main
```

### 6. **Documentation**

Docker usage was documented in a `README.md` file, which explained how to build and run containers.

### 7. **Security and Compliance**

Container security was ensured by using tools like `Docker Bench for Security`:
```bash
docker run -it --privileged --pid host docker/docker-bench-security
```

## **Conclusion**

This project utilized various techniques, from data analysis and model training to containerizing the application using Docker, ensuring scalability, security, and good performance. Docker allowed us to create isolated environments that enhanced reproducibility and deployment efficiency.
